# Green_Geek_Gods_Reboot
Repo for the Reboot 2022 Lloyds Hackathon for the Green Geek Gods team

The goal of this Hackathon project was to create a dashboard that would display carbon emissions statistics of a company, using power Bi, in real time.

Please refer to the wiki page for further information on the solution. https://github.com/JorgiEagle/Green_Geek_Gods_Reboot/wiki
